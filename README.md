## Course Description

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point of view. CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming.
In 61A, the correctness of a program was our primary goal. In CS61B, we're concerned also with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We'll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.

## Software

This official coding environment and text editor for the course is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called IntelliJ, though we will not introduce this IDE until Week 2. At your own discretion, you may instead use Vim, Emacs, Sublime, or IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, Emacs etc. Whatever you use, however, your submitted solutions must conform to our expected layouts, as indicated in the assignments. We strongly recommend that you use IntelliJ starting as soon as you finish project 0. We will not officially support any editing environment other than IntelliJ.
This semester, we will be using Java 8. It is already installed on the lab computers, and it may be provided with your computer as well.
You will be able to do any work you'd like on any Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux computer. You may also remotely log into the instructional machines (which you will receive an account for during the first week), though you should be able to most everything in the course by working natively on your own computer. Information for setting up your own computer is linked in lab 1b.
We'll be using the version-control system Git this semester. Version-control systems allow you maintain a series of "snapshots" of your files at various points in their development. Used properly, this provides you some back-up protection, so that you can recover previous states of your work when something goes wrong. Also for team-oriented projects (as well as in the real world), version-control systems help manage collaborative work.
You will be learning and using Git for this course to track your work and submit your assignment. In addition to the advantages above, using Git will allow the staff to track your progress in the course and maybe even help you out when you're stuck on bugs. The first lab will teach you the basics of what you will need to know. Feel free to also read official Git documentation.

## Programming Projects

In addition to the HWs and labs, there will be 4 programming projects. In these projects you will build an entire system. For project 0, you will be able to work with a partner. For project 2 you will be required to work with a partner, unless you specifically request otherwise (details TBA).
Project 0 and 1 will be relatively easier than projects 2 and 3, taking less time and with greater levels of scaffolding. Project 2 will be a very difficult project (on par with what you might expect from Hilfinger's harder projects). Project 3 will be challenging, but not as time consuming as project 2.
Each project has a specific theme:
Project 0: Introduction to Java
Project 1: Basic Design, Testing, and Code Review
Project 2: Large Scale Design and Testing
Project 3: Working with an Existing Code Base
For all projects, we will ultimately release all tests that determine your grade. In other words, passing all tests on Gradescope will allow you to earn full points for the autograded portion of the project.
240 Projects 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be worth 25, 40, 100, and 75 points respectively. For projects 2 and 3, there are opportunities for "gold points" described in each project specification.
